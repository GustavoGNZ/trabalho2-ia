      "Objetivo:\n",
      "\n",
      "We propose a simplified approach to identify the most critical threats faced by CAVs’ through monitoring the security context of both the CAVs and the environments they operate in.;;\n",
      "x We propose a method to manage the dynamic risks, which include a lightweight strategy to reduce the need for risk reassessment.;;\n",
      "x We present a case study to compare dynamic and static risk assessment approaches.;;\n",
      "In Section 5 we present and examine a case study for dynamic risk assessment in CAV systems, namely in platooning.;;\n",
      "Address high-risk (critical) threats effectively:  the ultimate aim of risk assessment after knowing all the possible options is to identify the high-risk threats (i.e. attacks with high likelihood and high impact).;;\n",
      "The aim of maintaining the attack surface knowledge is to support effect ive cross-referencing of any relevant vulnerabilities for all components.;;\n",
      "Gi ven this reduced list, analysis of the inters ections between the stakeholders’  interest and attackers ’ goals  will help to further identify the most critical threats among the others.;;\n",
      "In (ABCD), given the spoofing attacks on LIDAR, the knowledge-based system suggests that attackers aim to spoof nearby objects, which is part of a larger aim of slowing down the CAV (e.g. see the attack tr ee in Figure 5).;;\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Problema:\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that CAVs can be seriously impacted by  cyber-attacks, their security issues have been investigated widely.;;\n",
      "Many works have addressed CAV risk assessment issues by considering vulnerabilities in the cyber physical technologies that CAVs employ.;;\n",
      "However, challenges arise due to the complexity arising from the disparate fields of development [2], and the lack of support of the current methods for context awareness.;;\n",
      "Some important issues that still need to be considered  are the quality (e.g. when the infrastructure has significant traffic due to a high number of communications) and the reliab ility (e.g. spoofing) of the communication.;;\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Método:\n",

      "However, such vehicles operate in complex heterogeneous environments and it is  therefore essential to control the dynamic risks that the CAVs face during operation.;;\n",
      "Given that CAVs can be seriously impacted by  cyber-attacks, their security issues have been investigated widely.;;\n",
      "However, existing approach es fail to adequately consider the dynamicity  of the risks that arise and present methods to capture the changes in risks and adaptive mitigations.;;\n",
      "To bridge  these gaps, this paper proposes a systematic approach, which comprises of three modules: a knowledge-based sy stem to support the identification of th e critical threats, a monitoring module to detect the changes in security contex t of the CAV and its su rrounding environments, and a si mplified assessment module to capture the dynamic risks and adjust the mi tigations as needed.;;\n",
      "In this work, we develop a simplified approach to address the dynamic nature of cyber security  risk in CAV systems, which focuses on identifying the most  critical attacks that require monitoring and controlling as the environment changes.;;\n",
      "The contexts are analysed with the help of a knowledge-based system that  extracts the most critical threats on which to focus.;;\n",
      "There are also efforts to extend the STRIDE model to capture more threats, for example, the work in [13] added the Linkability  and Confusion  category to the STRIDE methodology.;;\n",
      "Manage and control dynamic risks  at different levels and from different aspects [14].;;\n",
      "Ideally for this purpose, security  analysts will need to be provided with a system architecture, which is “the descriptive representation of the system’s component functions and the communication flows between these components”;;\n",
      "While there exist different reference architectures for CAVs [5, 10, 18, 19], they either failed to consider  some critical functions of the system or the scope is too broad  or too detailed, leading to difficulties in application.;;\n",
      "The likelihood of achieving a su b-goal can be retrieved from the attack surface information that  lists the vulnerabilities of the corresponding components.;;\n",
      "For example, to analyse a system with specific components and functions, the knowledge-based system can suggest  a reduced list of threats to focus, instead of the large number of threats derived from traditional threat modelling.;;\n",
      "Gi ven this reduced list, analysis of the inters ections between the stakeholders’  interest and attackers ’ goals  will help to further identify the most critical threats among the others.;;\n",
      "This module comprises of five steps to manage risk inputs from module B as can be seen in Figure 1. Note that Step 1 and 2 are independent so they can  be conducted in any order, and in parallel.;;\n",
      "In such cases, the components that are in use will  be essential.;;\n",
      "In particular, only attack  from Step 1 that target the essential functions identified in Step 2 will be considered.;;\n",
      "It is difficult to identify threat agents, however, as their activities and behaviours (e.g. launched successful attack) are recorded by ITS, it  is possible to justify their capabilities.;;\n",
      "Assume  that for a specific area, the system records a list of n successful threats T = { t i, i=  ͳǡ݊} launched by m unknown attackers A = { aj, j = ͳǡ݉ }.;;\n",
      "As a result, instead of identifying capabilities  for all attackers, we only need to estimate the maximum cap abilities of all attackers in the group, which can be represented by GA: GA = ሾܣܩ௘௧ ܣܩ௘௫\u0003ܣܩ௞\u0003ܣܩ௪\u0003ܣܩ௘௤ሿ in which ܣܩ௙ =  ௙אሼ௘௧ǡ௘௫ǡ௞ǡ௪ǡ௘௤ ሽǢ௝ୀଵǡ௠ሼܥܣ௝௙ሽǤ To launch Ti successfully, the attackers should be able to bypass the system withstand for Ti, which means their group attack capability GA should be greater than defender capabilities DC;;\n",
      "For risk assessment, this information will be provided to every CAV in  transportation.;;\n",
      "Similarly, if attacker capability in the new area is less than that of the previous area while the CAV was confident of controlling the risks in the previous area, reassessing risks will be not necessary because risk level is not increased.;;\n",
      "A platooning scenario for dynamic risk assessment  The road XY can be divided in to three areas: (XA), (ABCD), and (DEY).;;\n",
      "There is  concern of spoofing attacks on LIDAR (e.g. these attacks have  happened recently); (DEY) There is concern of spoofing attacks on ultrasonic sensors (e.g. these attacks were recorded with high frequency).;;\n",
      "Some important issues that still need to be considered  are the quality (e.g. when the infrastructure has significant traffic due to a high number of communications) and the reliab ility (e.g. spoofing) of the communication.;;\n",
      "We have also considered a case  study of CAV in platooning, to emphasise the advantages of dynamic risk assessment over the existing static approaches.;;\n",
      "We anticipate that some of our future  work will be  to develop more uses of the knowledge-based  system on the security analysis, and to extend this res earch in simulation environment for further verification.;;\n",

      "Privacy challenges in CAV systems are can be analysed considering identity anonymisation and authentication in vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) by using schemes such as pseudonym-based privacy and group signatures.;;\n",
      "Recently, Qu et al. addressed and classified privacy challenges and requirements for vehicular networks [11].;;\n",

      "It proposes a novel taxonomy and discussed the identified state-of-the-art in Differential Privacy (a particular type of PET that is attracting significant attention) regarding its applicability to the privacy challenges in CAV functions we have identified.;;\n",
      "We then present the privacy challenges and privacy-preserving techniques, which have been identified through a semi-systematic review and qualitative analysis.;;\n",

      "Privacy Challenges As mentioned, CAVs create challenges in cybersecurity nd privacy, and there exist a number of research proposals for reducing the likelihood of cyber-attacks against CAVs.;;\n",
      "This section presents the privacy challenges of CAV systems.;;\n",
      "The privacy challenges both aris ing from participating in ITS and CAV functions are analysed through three subclasses: Data Privacy, Identity Privacy and Location Privacy.;;\n",
      "In the following, we will discuss the privacy challenges present due to the inter-vehicular communication involved in ITS.;;\n",
      "The privacy challenges in ITS are usually regarding identity and location but it is also required to ensure  access of public authorities to identify and location information for accountability purposes [27].;;\n",
      "The privacy challen ges in ITS influences all of the vehicles, however, there are additional privacy challenges regarding the functions of CAVs, such as traffic planning, 4 optimisation, safety and cooperative autonomous applications (e.g. platooning).;;\n",
      "People might encounter many privacy challenges during the use of CAVs.;;\n",
      "However, some of these challenges are not specific to CAVs, but rather they  are about being in a public place or in a taxi such as the privacy challenges due to vehicular external/internal cameras.;;\n",
      "In the following, we will discuss the perceived privacy challenges presents specifically due to the use of CAV functions.;;\n",
      "This presents a location privacy challenge since the user needs to reveal information about the start and the end locations of tr avel and it is highly likely that one of these is the user `s home or workplace.;;\n",
      "Therefore, these applications  present data privacy and location privacy challenges.;;\n",
      "However, the privacy challenges arising from participating in a platoon have not been widely discussed in the literature though designing platooning algorithms is receiving a great deal of attention.;;\n",
      "Clearly this approach is privacy-aware, though does not fully address all of the challenges.;;\n",
      "This presents identit y privacy and location privacy challenges.;;\n",

      "Lessons Learned and Open Issues The understanding of privacy changes for different people, communities and cultures, which should be considered when developing privacy mechanisms.;;\n",
      "A further challenge in privacy preservation is that privacy can be disclosed if a link can be established between different data entries of the same data owners.;;\n",

      "While the number of devices, and the degree of connectivity is growing, researchers have noted that we are in-creasingly unaware of the locations and purposes of such de-vices with consequences for the types of applications that canbe supported and for user trust in the IoT [17, 22].;;\n",
      "We present the results of a systematic literature review designed to help provide an initial understanding ofcybersecurity-related implications from mapping the IoT. 2.;;\n",
      "While one solution might be for some stan-dard to emerge for devices themselves, others have opted to instead create frameworks and systems to support the catalogu- ing and interactions for IoT devices with the goal of maximis-ing interoperability between heterogeneous IoT devices and services;;\n",

      ", we have only depicted one-way relationships, e.g., we have not depicted the inverse relationship “Source Contains Parameter”, since this is meant to be inferred from Table I. Hence edges in the Genoma data model represent relation- ships between the nodes, which can inform users of how the sensor data was processed and used. Hence these relationships between vertices in the data model allow users to navigate through them after retrieving the appropriate provenance data from the database. Please note that the Genoma data model is the same, whether on edge or cloud, allowing seamless transfer of provenance data from edge to cloud. B.Genoma architecture Based on its distributed nature, the architecture of Genoma is as shown in Fig. 2. Genoma has two main parts. On the edge, it captures and records provenance data via subscriptions to brokers (such as MQTT) on edge devices such as low-end computers or Rasp- berry PIs. Provenance capture and recording are separated in Genoma, in order to ensure independence from the underlying data processing system. After storage on the edge, provenance data is transmitted to the cloud based on policies set by the Policy Modeler. On the cloud, provenance data is collected via two means - from the edge via the Provenance Collector, and directly from the data stream processing system.All collected provenance data eventually gets stored in Apache Atlas on the cloud. Our implementation of Apache Atlas includes changes to its type system to accommodate our provenance data model. On the edge, we have used TinkerGraph along with ﬁle system storage for the following reasons: TinkerGraph’s graph model is the same as that of JanusGraph which is used in Apache Atlas; TinkerGraph can run on low-end edge devices (unlike Apache Atlas); and since TinkerGraph is only an in-memory data store, persistent storage on the edge is currently implemented via ﬁle system. Future work will investigate the use of lightweight graph databases for storing provenance data on the edge. Although all collected provenance data eventually is sup- posed to be stored on the cloud, Genoma’s distributed storage approach ensures that provenance data can be stored and processed (albeit temporarily) on the edge to accommodate network connectivity issues between edge and cloud, which are expected to occur in large-scale distributed IoT infrastruc- tures. On both edge and cloud, Genoma contains components for provenance modeling and viewing. On the cloud Genoma leverages Apache Atlas’s GUI, whereas on the edge, Genoma uses the Gremlin GUI compatible with Tinkergraph. IV.Genoma IMPLEMENTATION Our implementation approach for Genoma, as derived from Fig. 2, is as depicted in Fig. 3. Our edge implementation assumes the existence of a low- end device, such as a Raspberry Pi or low-end laptop with RAM not exceeding 2GB and storage not exceeding 80 GB. Due to the lack of any provenance tools that can work on such devices, we are currently building on the edge a mini- provenance engine as introduced in Section III-B and depicted in Fig. 3. The following components are being built on the edge: \u000fProvenance Capture: we have built a connector that subscribes to topics from a VerneMQ [18] broker running MQTT [17]. This connector parses the received data and extracts the appropriate provenance information from it. \u000fProvenance Recording: this is a connector that receives provenance data from the Provenance Capture connector and converts it into the format of our data model. This data is then stored on the edge device via the ﬁle system storage. Hence the separation of provenance recording and storage ensures that Genoma can act as a true “provenance as a service” since it would be agnostic of the underlying data stream processing system. \u000fProvenance Visualization: this component allows the user to visualize the stored provenance data. Visualization is implemented using TinkerGraph’s GUI feature. \u000fProvenance Transmitter: this component transmits prove- nance data to the cloud as per policies set by the Provenance Policy Modeler, which is explained in more detail below.

On the cloud we are building the following components as extensions to Apache Atlas: \u000fEnhanced Type System for Apache Atlas: as depicted in Fig. 3, this is an enhancement of Apache Atlas’s type system to incorporate the following: the additional constructs from our data model; links between these constructs so as to represent edges in our data model;and version attributes to represent versioning of nodes and edges in the data model, which would thereby represent data lineage, i.e., the origin of the data, where it was used, and how it was used, as part of overall workﬂow provenance which can be visualized using Apache Atlas’s user interface. \u000fProvenance Collector: this component performs the fol- lowing functions: it receives the provenance data sent by the Provenance Transmitter; and it also (based on policies speciﬁed via the Provenance Policy Modeler on the cloud) sends requests for provenance data.

Genoma Visualization on the Edge stored in Apache Atlas’s database for subsequent query and retrieval by users and external applications. An example data lineage graph derived from Genoma data stored in Apache Atlas, and visualized via Apache Atlas’s GUI, is depicted in Fig. 5. Fig. 5. Data Lineage Visualization on Apache Atlas We are also building a Provenance Policy Modeler, which will be installed on both the edge and cloud. The objectives of this modeler are the following: \u000fOn the Edge: at a minimum, ensure that the (resource- constrained) edge device does not run out of storage space by transmitting provenance data to the cloud; in addition, transmit provenance data as per rules set by the user on the edge. \u000fOn the Cloud: send requests for provenance data to the edge device as per policies set by the user on the cloud. In addition to all the above, on the cloud, our implementa- tion has two aspects. First, we implement the same provenancecapture and recording services as on the edge, but with cru- cial differences: (a) provenance capture service here directly interfaces with the underlying data stream processing system on the cloud (currently we are using Apache Pulsar [19]); (b) provenance recording service converts the collected data and translates it into Apache Atlas’s data format. A snippet of the Genoma type system represented in Apache Atlas is illustrated in Fig. 6. Fig. 6. Genoma Type System Illustration Hence our Genoma implementation meets our key require- ments, viz., agnostic of the underlying data processing system (hence “provenance as a service”), and distributed across edge and cloud. This raises a number of key research challenges, which we discuss in the next section. While doing so, we also report our ongoing work in addressing the research challenges. V. D ISCUSSION We have identiﬁed the following key research challenges forGenoma going forward. Real-time Provenance Capture and Recording: As discussed in [10], provenance capture should be low overhead so as not to overload the underlying data stream processing system, as well as to ensure that no provenance data is missed. Provenance data can be missed if the speed of provenance data capture is lower than the speed at which the underlying data is transmitted. To that end, the citation [9] presents a “time-value-centric (TVC)” approach towards data provenance capture. In Genoma, we have addressed this issue by only capturing provenance data at speciﬁc state changes, viz., start of a workﬂow, end of the workﬂow, workﬂow suspension, workﬂow resumption. Workﬂows can be suspended due to many reasons, viz., faults in the underlying data stream processing system; movement of data processing to another location (e.g., changing the location of a broker or any other data processing location); and change in data insert rate due to operators changing the frequency at which data is transmitted. Provenance Data Storage and Transmission: There has been some research on provenance data storage, especially in the2019 IEEE 5th World Forum on Internet of Things (WF-IoT) 759Authorized licensed use limited to: UNIVERSIDADE ESTADUAL DE MARINGA. Downloaded on July 14,2025 at 23:02:18 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. cloud [7], [20]. However, this research has focused more on efﬁcient storage, with emphasis on optimizing queries on provenance data. In particular, these works have focused on how to enhance current storage systems to make them more “provenance-aware”. In Genoma, on the other hand, our emphasis is more on efﬁcient provenance storage on resource- constrained edge devices, to which end we are developing our Policy Modeler to ensure optimal usage of edge device storage. Efﬁcient provenance data transmission from edge to cloud : the following research issues dominate, and we are investigating them as part of our work on Genoma: (a) optimal data transmission policies balancing storage availability on the edge and network overhead of provenance data transmission; (b) data compression techniques to facilitate faster provenance data transmission; (c) decompression at the cloud, along with techniques for correlating recently received provenance data with already stored provenance data, for the purpose of establishing data lineage and thereby facilitating accurate provenance data visualization on the cloud. Techniques such as those described in [21] may be applicable here. Securing Provenance Data: This is a crucial topic that has received some attention in the literature, with emphasis on securing data provenance on the cloud [22]–[25]. Given that theGenoma model is graph-based, we are currently extending the approach from [22] to develop a lattice-based role based access control model for provenance graphs in Genoma. This model will provide administrators to specify varying levels of access to Genoma nodes and/or edges to a user based on the user’s level in the organizational hierarchy and based on the extent to which they are authorized to view (subsets of) stored provenance data. The latter, in particular, is based on the well- known attribute-based role based access control model [26]. We will be reporting more details of our security approach in a future paper. VI. C ONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have presented our ongoing work on Genoma, our distriuted IoT Provenance as a Service solu- tion. Genoma’s key features, missing in current work on provenance, are: it is agnostic of the underlying data stream processing system; it is offered “as a Service (aaS)”, and it is distributed across edge and cloud by design. We introduced the architecture of Genoma, along with our implementation approach. Apart from the points mentioned in Section V, our fu- ture work will also involve identifying key benchmarks for Genoma, such as processing overhead or energy consumption, and evaluating Genoma against them.\n",

      "We propose a simplified approach to identify the most critical threats faced by CAVs’ through monitoring the security context of both the CAVs and the environments they operate in.;;\n",
      "x We propose a method to manage the dynamic risks, which include a lightweight strategy to reduce the need for risk reassessment.;;\n",
      "x We present a case study to compare dynamic and static risk assessment approaches.;;\n",
      "In Section 5 we present and examine a case study for dynamic risk assessment in CAV systems, namely in platooning.;;\n",
      "Address high-risk (critical) threats effectively:  the ultimate aim of risk assessment after knowing all the possible options is to identify the high-risk threats (i.e. attacks with high likelihood and high impact).;;\n",
      "The aim of maintaining the attack surface knowledge is to support effect ive cross-referencing of any relevant vulnerabilities for all components.;;\n",
      "Gi ven this reduced list, analysis of the inters ections between the stakeholders’  interest and attackers ’ goals  will help to further identify the most critical threats among the others.;;\n",
      "In (ABCD), given the spoofing attacks on LIDAR, the knowledge-based system suggests that attackers aim to spoof nearby objects, which is part of a larger aim of slowing down the CAV (e.g. see the attack tr ee in Figure 5).;;\n",

      "Problema:\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that CAVs can be seriously impacted by  cyber-attacks, their security issues have been investigated widely.;;\n",
      "Many works have addressed CAV risk assessment issues by considering vulnerabilities in the cyber physical technologies that CAVs employ.;;\n",
      "However, challenges arise due to the complexity arising from the disparate fields of development [2], and the lack of support of the current methods for context awareness.;;\n",
      "Some important issues that still need to be considered  are the quality (e.g. when the infrastructure has significant traffic due to a high number of communications) and the reliab ility (e.g. spoofing) of the communication.;;\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "However, such vehicles operate in complex heterogeneous environments and it is  therefore essential to control the dynamic risks that the CAVs face during operation.;;\n",
      "Given that CAVs can be seriously impacted by  cyber-attacks, their security issues have been investigated widely.;;\n",
      "However, existing approach es fail to adequately consider the dynamicity  of the risks that arise and present methods to capture the changes in risks and adaptive mitigations.;;\n",
      "To bridge  these gaps, this paper proposes a systematic approach, which comprises of three modules: a knowledge-based sy stem to support the identification of th e critical threats, a monitoring module to detect the changes in security contex t of the CAV and its su rrounding environments, and a si mplified assessment module to capture the dynamic risks and adjust the mi tigations as needed.;;\n",
      "In this work, we develop a simplified approach to address the dynamic nature of cyber security  risk in CAV systems, which focuses on identifying the most  critical attacks that require monitoring and controlling as the environment changes.;;\n",
      "The contexts are analysed with the help of a knowledge-based system that  extracts the most critical threats on which to focus.;;\n",
      "There are also efforts to extend the STRIDE model to capture more threats, for example, the work in [13] added the Linkability  and Confusion  category to the STRIDE methodology.;;\n",
      "Manage and control dynamic risks  at different levels and from different aspects [14].;;\n",
      "Ideally for this purpose, security  analysts will need to be provided with a system architecture, which is “the descriptive representation of the system’s component functions and the communication flows between these components”;;\n",
      "While there exist different reference architectures for CAVs [5, 10, 18, 19], they either failed to consider  some critical functions of the system or the scope is too broad  or too detailed, leading to difficulties in application.;;\n",
      "The likelihood of achieving a su b-goal can be retrieved from the attack surface information that  lists the vulnerabilities of the corresponding components.;;\n",
      "For example, to analyse a system with specific components and functions, the knowledge-based system can suggest  a reduced list of threats to focus, instead of the large number of threats derived from traditional threat modelling.;;\n",
      "Gi ven this reduced list, analysis of the inters ections between the stakeholders’  interest and attackers ’ goals  will help to further identify the most critical threats among the others.;;\n",
      "This module comprises of five steps to manage risk inputs from module B as can be seen in Figure 1. Note that Step 1 and 2 are independent so they can  be conducted in any order, and in parallel.;;\n",
      "In such cases, the components that are in use will  be essential.;;\n",
      "In particular, only attack  from Step 1 that target the essential functions identified in Step 2 will be considered.;;\n",
      "It is difficult to identify threat agents, however, as their activities and behaviours (e.g. launched successful attack) are recorded by ITS, it  is possible to justify their capabilities.;;\n",
      "Assume  that for a specific area, the system records a list of n successful threats T = { t i, i=  ͳǡ݊} launched by m unknown attackers A = { aj, j = ͳǡ݉ }.;;\n",
      "As a result, instead of identifying capabilities  for all attackers, we only need to estimate the maximum cap abilities of all attackers in the group, which can be represented by GA: GA = ሾܣܩ௘௧ ܣܩ௘௫\u0003ܣܩ௞\u0003ܣܩ௪\u0003ܣܩ௘௤ሿ in which ܣܩ௙ =  ௙אሼ௘௧ǡ௘௫ǡ௞ǡ௪ǡ௘௤ ሽǢ௝ୀଵǡ௠ሼܥܣ௝௙ሽǤ To launch Ti successfully, the attackers should be able to bypass the system withstand for Ti, which means their group attack capability GA should be greater than defender capabilities DC;;\n",
      "For risk assessment, this information will be provided to every CAV in  transportation.;;\n",
      "Similarly, if attacker capability in the new area is less than that of the previous area while the CAV was confident of controlling the risks in the previous area, reassessing risks will be not necessary because risk level is not increased.;;\n",
      "A platooning scenario for dynamic risk assessment  The road XY can be divided in to three areas: (XA), (ABCD), and (DEY).;;\n",
      "There is  concern of spoofing attacks on LIDAR (e.g. these attacks have  happened recently); (DEY) There is concern of spoofing attacks on ultrasonic sensors (e.g. these attacks were recorded with high frequency).;;\n",
      "Some important issues that still need to be considered  are the quality (e.g. when the infrastructure has significant traffic due to a high number of communications) and the reliab ility (e.g. spoofing) of the communication.;;\n",
      "We have also considered a case  study of CAV in platooning, to emphasise the advantages of dynamic risk assessment over the existing static approaches.;;\n",
      "We anticipate that some of our future  work will be  to develop more uses of the knowledge-based  system on the security analysis, and to extend this res earch in simulation environment for further verification.;;\n",

      "This work categorises the emerging privacy challenges and solutions for CAV systems and identifies the knowledge ga p for future research, which will minimise and mitigate privacy concerns without hampering the efficacy of the functions.;;\n",
      "Privacy challenges in CAV systems are can be analysed considering identity anonymisation and authentication in vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) by using schemes such as pseudonym-based privacy and group signatures.;;\n",
      "Recently, Qu et al. addressed and classified privacy challenges and requirements for vehicular networks [11].;;\n",
      "However, privacy challenges that might arise out of the CAV functions (e.g. location-based services, etc.) have not been included.;;\n",
      "Asuquo et al. analysed the privacy requirements, challenges and approaches Location-Based Services (LBS) in vehicular networks;;\n",
      "To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first review, which delivers a 2 comprehensive analysis of th e privacy challenges of both vehicular networks and CAV functions.;;\n",
      "It proposes a novel taxonomy and discussed the identified state-of-the-art in Differential Privacy (a particular type of PET that is attracting significant attention) regarding its applicability to the privacy challenges in CAV functions we have identified.;;\n",
      "We then present the privacy challenges and privacy-preserving techniques, which have been identified through a semi-systematic review and qualitative analysis.;;\n",
      "Finally, we discussed the potential applicability of the state-of-the-art privacy-preserving approaches for the privacy challenges and in CAV systems.;;\n",
      "Table 1 Paper review protocol Criteria Description Timeframe Between 1998 and 2018 Language English Aims x To identify privacy challenges in ITS and CAV functions.;;\n",
      "Privacy Challenges As mentioned, CAVs create challenges in cybersecurity nd privacy, and there exist a number of research proposals for reducing the likelihood of cyber-attacks against CAVs.;;\n",
      "This section presents the privacy challenges of CAV systems.;;\n",
      "The privacy challenges both aris ing from participating in ITS and CAV functions are analysed through three subclasses: Data Privacy, Identity Privacy and Location Privacy.;;\n",
      "In the following, we will discuss the privacy challenges present due to the inter-vehicular communication involved in ITS.;;\n",
      "The privacy challenges in ITS are usually regarding identity and location but it is also required to ensure  access of public authorities to identify and location information for accountability purposes [27].;;\n",
      "The privacy challen ges in ITS influences all of the vehicles, however, there are additional privacy challenges regarding the functions of CAVs, such as traffic planning, 4 optimisation, safety and cooperative autonomous applications (e.g. platooning).;;\n",
      "People might encounter many privacy challenges during the use of CAVs.;;\n",
      "However, some of these challenges are not specific to CAVs, but rather they  are about being in a public place or in a taxi such as the privacy challenges due to vehicular external/internal cameras.;;\n",
      "In the following, we will discuss the perceived privacy challenges presents specifically due to the use of CAV functions.;;\n",
      "This presents a location privacy challenge since the user needs to reveal information about the start and the end locations of tr avel and it is highly likely that one of these is the user `s home or workplace.;;\n",
      "Therefore, these applications  present data privacy and location privacy challenges.;;\n",
      "However, the privacy challenges arising from participating in a platoon have not been widely discussed in the literature though designing platooning algorithms is receiving a great deal of attention.;;\n",
      "Clearly this approach is privacy-aware, though does not fully address all of the challenges.;;\n",
      "This presents identit y privacy and location privacy challenges.;;\n",
      "The privacy challenges here can be associated with identity, location and data privacy.;;\n",
      "For these reasons, implementing DP in the vehicular domain has challenges.;;\n",
      "The challenges with using techniques based on cryptography are that the approaches generally introduce high computational and communicational overheads [50].;;\n",
      "Lessons Learned and Open Issues The understanding of privacy changes for different people, communities and cultures, which should be considered when developing privacy mechanisms.;;\n",
      "A further challenge in privacy preservation is that privacy can be disclosed if a link can be established between different data entries of the same data owners.;;\n",
      "The identified privacy challenges with respect to CAV functions are summarised in Table 5.;;\n",
      "Designing DP mechanisms can mitigate the privacy risks for the challenges.;;\n",

      "8 Conclusion In this work, we have analysed the complete CAV systems regarding the privacy challenges arise from participating in ITS and CAV functions.;;\n",
      "We have also identified the approaches might be applied to mitigate such privacy challenges.;;\n",

      "Modern vehicles are evolving to  be safer, more energy efficient, more comfortable and accessible by being equipped with a wide range of sensors and ECUs.;;\n",
      "We consider research published between 1998, the year Latanya Sweeney’s seminal work on  k -anonymity;;\n",
      "Include The highly cited papers and the recent  3 years` papers are prioritised.;;\n",
      "In the early stages, privacy was firmly aligned with secrecy, as the Code of Hammurabi has brought the protection of the house of every Ancient Babylonian against others` intrusion.;;\n",
      "In the 1800s, privacy was defined as the “right to be let alone” [15].;;\n",
      "Dwork noted that privacy could be disclosed when  a link is established between different data points of the same data owners;;\n",
      "The recent EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has asserted that privacy should  be taken into account from the early stage of system development rather than implementing privacy protection mechanisms later.;;\n",
      "CAVs generate a massive amount of rich-dimensionality data, which is utilised by a variety of functions and shared  with other applications.;;\n",
      "Privacy and anonymity  The users and vehicles should not be able to identify or tracked by the exchanged messages.;;\n",
      "Traceability and revocation  The authorities should be able to detect malicious entities and verify their identities.;;\n",
      "The privacy challenges in ITS are usually regarding identity and location but it is also required to ensure  access of public authorities to identify and location information for accountability purposes [27].;;\n",
      "ITSs involve different type of  vehicles and different level of autonomies.;;\n",
      "However, some of these challenges are not specific to CAVs, but rather they  are about being in a public place or in a taxi such as the privacy challenges due to vehicular external/internal cameras.;;\n",
      "Therefore, these applications  present data privacy and location privacy challenges.;;\n",
      "From the OEMs` perspective, it can be analysed  to develop new products and services.;;\n",
      "6  Privacy-Preserving Approaches Developing privacy-preserving approaches has gained significant attention in a variety of application domains.;;\n",
      "It was originally thought that privacy preservation could be achieved by anonymising the data.;;\n",
      "It states that if a data entry in ݇ data entries cannot be identified from the rest of the ݇െͳ  data entries, the dataset has k- anonymity;;\n",
      "limitations of k-anonymity have been addressed, and the l- diversity method was developed as an extension [38] followed by t-closeness [39].;;\n",
      "global sensitivity is used for count  and sum queries, however, it returns high values for the queries like median  and average .;;\n",
      "[46] 2017 DP mechanisms for vehicles  Discussed different mechanisms of DP.;;\n",
      "[47] 2018 Intelligent Route Planning  Proposed Scalable Privacy Mechanism.;;\n",
      "Thus there may arise a trade-off between privacy protection and safety, and this is considered  be one of the open research areas [51].;;\n",
      "By  the nature of data, the perfect privacy protection can be only achieved by publishing no data, which is impossible for many CAV functions.;;\n",
